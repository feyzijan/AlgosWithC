# CSE 6010 Assignment 2 Overview

Here I implement a priority queue (PQ) module for managing flight information using a singly-linked-list data structure. The PQ module is designed to be used as part of a software library and includes the following functionalities:

1. Define a data structure called Flightinfo, representing flight information, including airline, flight number, and departure time.
2. Define a data structure called Item, representing a PQ item with flight information, priority (time), and a pointer to the next item.
3. Implement an initialization function to create the initial PQ with a dummy flight.
4. Implement a function to add a flight to the PQ.
5. Implement a function to remove the highest priority flight from the PQ.
6. Implement a function to print the contents of the PQ.
7. Implement a function to count the number of items in the PQ.
8. Implement a function to count the number of items with a specific airline in the PQ.


Can Run "make" and then "./pq" in the terminal
