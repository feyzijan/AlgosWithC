Here the C program reads graph information from a file and outputs various information about the graph. The program should accomplish the following tasks:

1. Read graph information from a file (testgraph.txt) that specifies a directed graph using an adjacency-matrix representation.

2. Store the graph information as a dynamically allocated 1-dimensional (1D) array of integer values.

3. Calculate the in-degree and out-degree of each vertex and output this information to the screen.

4. Find all 2-hop paths with distinct vertices contained in the graph.

The code focuses on handling adjacency matrices, dynamically allocating memory, and performing graph-related calculations in C.
