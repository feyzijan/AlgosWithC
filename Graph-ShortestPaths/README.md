# CSE 6010 Workshop 3

This assignment required completing a provided C code scaffold to calculate the diameter of a graph represented as an adjacency matrix using the all-pairs shortest paths algorithm. The program specified the graph using the `getGraph()` function, and you needed to update the representation for non-edges between distinct vertices. The number of iterations for matrix multiplication was determined based on the number of vertices. Within each iteration, you had to perform the all-pairs shortest paths algorithm and calculate the diameter as the maximum of the shortest distances.

Submission instructions:
- Due Date: October 12, 11:59 PM
- Submit `diameter.c`, `contrib.txt`, and `howthingswent.txt` to Gradescope through Canvas.

For more details and code scaffold, please refer to the workshop assignment document provided in your course materials.
