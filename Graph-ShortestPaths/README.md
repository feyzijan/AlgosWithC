Here I calculate the diameter of a graph represented as an adjacency matrix using the all-pairs shortest paths algorithm. The program specified the graph using the `getGraph()` function, and you needed to update the representation for non-edges between distinct vertices. The number of iterations for matrix multiplication was determined based on the number of vertices. Within each iteration, you had to perform the all-pairs shortest paths algorithm and calculate the diameter as the maximum of the shortest distances.
