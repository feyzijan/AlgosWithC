# Battery Purchase Optimization

This C program is designed to optimize battery purchases based on pricing information. Given a set of battery prices and the number of batteries needed, the program calculates the most cost-effective way to purchase batteries to minimize the total cost.

## Usage

To compile the program, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -o battery_purchase battery_purchase.c
```

To run the program with an input file, use the following command:

```bash
./battery_purchase input_file [options]
```

- `input_file`: The name of the input file containing battery pricing information.
- `options`: An optional argument to specify additional output options.
  - `d`: Display the batteries used to achieve the optimal cost.

## Input File Format

The input file should have the following format:

```
n
p1
p2
...
pn
```

- `n`: The number of battery prices.
- `p1, p2, ..., pn`: Prices of batteries from 1 to n.

## Output

The program will output the optimal cost of purchasing batteries. If the `-d` option is provided, it will also display the batteries used to achieve the optimal cost.

## Example Usage

```bash
./battery_purchase input.txt d
```
