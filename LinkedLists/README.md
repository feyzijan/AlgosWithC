# Workshop 1 Overview

This workshop assignment focuses on two main objectives:

1. **Returning Information Three Ways:**
   - Create an array of 100 nonnegative double values.
   - Implement three functions to find and return the maximum value and its index.
   - Explore different methods for returning multiple pieces of information from a function.

2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation and Memory Leaks:**
   - Create a linked list of 10 items with integer values.
   - Initialize and manipulate the linked list.
   - Practice dynamic memory allocation and memory management.
   - Use "valgrind" to check for memory leaks.

The assignment encourages you to develop proficiency in C programming and introduces essential concepts like function return strategies and memory management.
