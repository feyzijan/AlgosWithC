Implemented the Quicksort algorithm and used it to sort an array of items. Each item consists of three double values, and the sorting is based on the second value of each item. Here are the key steps:

1. Define a struct to represent an item containing three double values.

2. Read item information from a file, where the first line specifies the number of items, and subsequent lines contain the three double values for each item. Dynamically allocate an array to store this information.

3. Implement the Quicksort algorithm, sorting the array of items based on the second double value.

4. Count the number of times the Quicksort algorithm is called for analysis.

5. Optionally, print out the sorted array if the second command-line argument is specified as "p."

The code focuses on implementing the Quicksort algorithm, handling file input, and analyzing its performance on different data sets.
